    <h2>Crowdsourced CO2 Readings</h2>
    <div id="mapdiv"></div>
    One of the important factors in mitigating transmission of COVID-19 is ventilation of the space.
    However, it can be difficult to measure ventilation directly as a vistor to a space without access to
    specifications related to the building. CO2 monitoring can be done using a handheld device that is easily operated by people
    interacting with public spaces. These devices can range from roughly 50-500 dollars and many Canadian library systems are
    setting up lending programs.

    This project is set up to help the public make informed decisions about COVID-19 risk by allowing communitiy members who have access
    to CO2 monitoring technology to contribute data to our map, which can then be viewed by anyone.
